# The default name for a helmfile is helmfile.yaml


# Install required dependencies using init
helmfile init


# Sync your Kubernetes cluster state to the desired one by running:
helmfile apply
 Use helmfile apply when you want to review changes before applying them.
 Compares current state with desired state (diff), shows changes, and then applies them only if necessary. 
 It fails if changes are detected and helm-diff is not installed.

# helm sync
Forces installation/upgrade of all releases in the Helmfile without checking for differences. 
It ensures everything matches the Helmfile state.
